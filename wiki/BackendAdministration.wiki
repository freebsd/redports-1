== Administering Redports Tinderbox Backends ==

A Redports Tinderbox Backend is not much more then a normal Tinderbox but
there are a few shell scripts available that help with maintenance tasks.


=== General notes ===

Whenever a job is started on a backend a folder with all the metadata is
kept in *`/tmp/rptinderbox/<buildname>`*.

For debugging purposes a logfile that includes the communication trace is
kept in *`/var/log/rptinderbox/<buildname>.log`*. This is usually a good
starting point if you want to have a closer look at why something isn't
working.


=== Cleanup failed Environment ===

It can happen for various reasons that an environment fails and needs to
be cleaned up manually. This is especially the case after a panic.

{{{
# rpmaintainbuild -r <buildname>
}}}

In the webinterface you also need to recover the failed backendbuild.

=== Cleanup failed backend ===

Whenever a backend panics some manual steps are required to get it back
to work. This needs to be done for all environments that have a lock
directory in *`/tmp/rptinderbox`*.

{{{
# rpmaintainbuild -r <buildname>
}}}

In the webinterface you also need to enable the backend again and recover
all failed backendbuilds.

Recover all failed backendbuilds:

Enable the backend:

=== Cleanup package cache ===

Whenever ports people change important ports without bumping all dependent
ports (but usually write an UPDATING entry) it's impossible for tinderbox
to know about that. So if you see strange dependency errors this might be the cause.

Before you do that it's important that the backend is completely idle and
disabled in the webinterface to ensure that no new jobs are schedule to
the backend while you do maintenance.

The `tbcleanup` step can take multiple hours and cannot be cancelled easily.
So it is recommended to run it in screen/tmux.

{{{
# cd /usr/local/tinderbox && rm -R errors/* logs/* packages/* wrkdirs/*
# /usr/local/tinderbox/scripts/tc tbcleanup
}}}


=== Updating build environment ===

From time to time you should update all environments that are build on top
of FreeBSD stable branches or FreeBSD current.
This will also clean the package cache for that environment so it will take
multiple hours.

{{{
# rpmaintainbuild -u <buildname>
}}}
